Deployment:
------------
its a recommended way to deploy a pod and RS is the internally it will deploy RS. we use this bcoz in RS and RC we cant update the version of the image we have. but in Deployment 
we can.

Benifits:
* Internally set a RS. it will mange the pods.
* It will set all pod specs.
*Roll back to older deployment version.
*Scale up and down
*pause and resuem the deployment
*Clean up the older RS that you dont need anymore.
