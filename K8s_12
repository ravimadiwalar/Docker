In Real Time nobody wikl remember that load balancer IP. so we have to create a domain for that load balancer. 

we can do this domain in Route 53 in AWS. 53 is its port. here we have to mention our load balancer external IP. user can acccess it from that domain name directly. here we can 
access the data of the private subnet also via load balancer extrtnal IP.

Cluster AutoScaler: 
-------------------
        It will scale the servers. but POD autoscaler(HPA) will scale the pods. while creating the EKS cluster we have mentioned that MIn servers 2 and Max servers 5 in Node group. 

Now we have 2 min servers but if we terminate one node. whichever pods under that node will fit into other node which is running. but it will take 5 mins this is k8s work.
kubectl get pods -o wide

but aws will create one new node bcoz desired nodes mentioned is 2. when our servers are running out of resources then it will create one more node.

Now we have 2 nodes with 8 gb each. in application yml file we have mentioned resource as 1 gb. it means we can create 13-14 pods. 

lets do
