Docker repo- Where you can store one or more versions of a specific docker image.
Docker registry- Registry is a collection of one or more docker repo
docker hub is a public registry 
private registries (we can store our own repo and access to our company only) are Nexus/Jfrog. in aws ECR(elastic cobntainer registry). in google GCR and in Azure ACR.

docker images or docker image ls - using these commands we can how many images are there in our server.
image fallows the layared architecture. it contains multiple layers.docker is maintaining all layers.

docker working directory - /var/lib/docker
ubuntu@172.23.42.212:~maven-web-apliacation$sudo ls /var/lib/docker
builder  buidkit  containers  image  network  overlay2 plugins  voluemes....... 

above in working dir we can files like container, images.    image conatin all images and conatiner conatin all containers in server.
ubuntu@172.23.42.212:~maven-web-apliacation$sudo ls /var/lib/docker/image/overlay2
it conatisn all image info

ubuntu@172.23.42.212:~maven-web-apliacation$docker images
REPOSITORY                                 TAG    IMAGESID     CREATED   SIZE 
dockerhandson/maven-web-application         1                             380MB
dockerhandson/maven-web-application        none                           380MB
tomcat                              7-jdk-corretto                      374MB

above we have image details but we didnt create any image in the name of tomact. 
why its showing under image bcoz we used this as a base image.  on top if this we cretaed our own image.if we run the container we wont this tomcat there. 

now we have to push that iamge to container but we have to authenticate it first.  

docker login -u <username> -p <password> <URL>

for dockerhub we dont need to give URL. for private registry we have to 

[ for biulding an image in private registry 
for Nexus - docker build -t 172.67.180.120:8083/maven-web-appliaction:1 .
                            (nexus server ip adress:port)

for ECR-   docker image -t amazon.ecr.1265.com/maven-web-application:1 .
                           ( ECR URL)
]

if we want to authenticate with private registry we have to fallow below ones
for Nexus - docker login -u admin -p admin123 172.67.180.120:808
for ECR  -  docker login -u admin -p admin123 amazon.ecr.1265.com

now we have to push that imahe to registry
ubuntu@172.23.42.212:~maven-web-apliacation$docker push dockerhandson/maven-web-application:1

it pushes all layers of that image to registry. go to docker hub and refresh your registry there we can get this in 1 (version). 

if we want to oull the image to another container
docker pull dockerhandson/maven-web-appliaction:1 .
