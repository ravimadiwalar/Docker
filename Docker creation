lets create one instance in aws with Ubuntu server and set server name as Build-Server. now go nad connect to this ssh with linux.
go to git hub of mithun technologies and take " Maven web application" project. here we have docker file already, if not we have to create it. now copy that link code and clone to our linux.
[ec2-user....]$git clone https://github.com/MithunTechnologiesDevOps/maven-web-application.git
[ec2-user...]$ ls
Maven-web-application
[ec2-user] cd maven-web-appliaction
[ec2-user ...maven-web-application] ls maven-web-appliaction
Dockerfile   Jenkinsfile ........
[ec2-user]$rm Dockerfile

Above we have Docker file but lets remove and create our own.  this project is java based appliaction so we need Java and Tomcat/Jboss/wildfly as a application server to run that project.
we get this in DockerHub and always we should refer Official Images.  bcoz we dont get any hacking code here and these are not vulnerable.
[ec2-user...]$ vi Dockerfile

FROM tomcat:7-Jdk8-correctto
COPY target/java-web-application*.war/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/java-web-appliaction.war
:wq

AboveTomcat is a repo and 7-Jdk8-correctto is a version and next we have to copy our application.
target/maven-web-application.war- is where our appliaction is
usr/local/tomcat/webapps/java-web-appliaction.war- is whwere it has to get copied. 
/usr/local/tomcat- for this part . go to that tomact image in dockerhub and come down, there we can see 
CATALINA HOME- /usr/local/tomcat    Tomcat home directory. 

now we have to create a docker image. we need to install docker here
ubuntu@ip172-12-23-12:~maven-web-appliaction$ sudo apt docker.io
.
.
.
. 
ubuntu@ip172-12-23-12:~maven-web-appliaction$ sudo apt update -y
.
.
.
.
above we have installed docker in Ubuntu - sudo apt docker.io and for updation sudo apt update -y
