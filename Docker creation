lets create one instance in aws with Ubuntu server and set server name as Build-Server. now go nad connect to this ssh with linux.
go to git hub of mithun technologies and take " Maven web application" project. here we have docker file already, if not we have to create it. now copy that link code and clone to our linux.
[ec2-user....]$git clone https://github.com/MithunTechnologiesDevOps/maven-web-application.git
[ec2-user...]$ ls
Maven-web-application
[ec2-user] ls maven-web-appliaction
Dockerfile   Jenkinsfile ........
[ec2-user]$rm Dockerfile

Above we have Docker file but lets remove and create our own.  this project is java based appliaction so we need Java and Tomcat/Jboss/wildfly as a application server to run that project.
[ec2-user...]$ vi Dockerfile

FROM tomcat:7-Jdk8-correctto
COPY target/maven-web-application.war/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/java-web-appliaction.war
:wq

AboveTomcat is a repo and 7-Jdk8-correctto is a version and next we have to copy our application.
target/maven-web-application.war- is where our appliaction is
usr/local/tomcat/webapps/java-web-appliaction.war- is whwere it has to get copied
