==> Type of Autoscaling:
1) Vartical scaling: The capacity of the server will increase. for eg. if we have 4 core 8GB. we can change that to 8 core 32 GB. 
2) Horizontal Scaling: here we will increse the servers with same capacity. will attached these with load balanacer and it will route all the traffic equally. 

In K8s we can do both Vertical and Horizontal Scaling. 

=> POD Autoscaler:
1) HPA: Horizontal POD Autoscaler
2) VPA: Vericatl POD Autoscaler
