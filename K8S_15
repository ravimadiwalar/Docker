Now we have created java-web-app chart and want to add that to repository in guthub, we can add that too in nexus and jfrog also. 

first we need to validate that chart is validate or not. to check that we use 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-11-34:~$ helm lint java-web-app/
==> Linting java-web-app/
[INFO] Chart.yaml: icon is recommended

1 chart(s) linted, 0 chart(s) failed

it means the tempates are proper. nothing has failed. 
Now we have to craete a package. -> helm package java-web-app
It will create a tar file. (java-web-app-0.1.0.tgz)

ubuntu@ip-172-31-11-34:~$ helm package java-web-app
Successfully packaged chart and saved it to: /home/ubuntu/java-web-app-0.1.0.tgz

ubuntu@ip-172-31-11-34:~$ ls
aws  awscliv2.zip  get_helm.sh  java-web-app  java-web-app-0.1.0.tgz  kubectl  kubernetes-ingress

If we want to maintain this one has a source code in github, we should do some setting in repository. 
Git- create a repo- go inside that repo- setting- GitHub pages - click it out here- choose mainbarnch as a Source and save.
