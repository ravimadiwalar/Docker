1) Liveness Probe: 
        using this we can  restart the container if it fails. this is a kind of health check. the process is running but the application is not accessed by the end user. that time
 will do the health check and here the readiness probe will stop the traffic to move to that pod. and liveness probe will restart the container/application.
