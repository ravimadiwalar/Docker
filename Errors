error: No preemption victims found
It means the enough resources (CPU, Memory and disk) not found. we need to increse the resources (instace types).


error: resource mapping not found for name: "mongopvc" namespace: "" from "deploymentpvc.yml": no matches for kind "persistentVolumeClaim" in version "v1"
ensure CRDs are installed first
==> we should check the names (capaital or small letter). here i had persistentVolumeClaim instead of "PersistentVolumeClaim"


=> Diff btw web and apllication server: 
   Web Server: static data it will provide
   Application Server: Dynamic data i will provide

@ Software remote location server tools? 
=> SSH , RDP(Remote Desktop Protocol) and AnyDesk. 

df -h -> HardDisk

top -> CPU memory info
