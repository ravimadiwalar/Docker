==> Headless Service: 
          If we consider the clusterIP or Nodeport IP , they will use load balancer concept in assigning the application requests to service. but in Headless service we dont 
have that laod balancer concept. here will reach those pods directly. 

Database concepts: 
       suppose if we have 3 replicas
mongo-0    primary
rs.init()
mongo-1    secondary
mongo-2    secondary

in data base we can see the concepts of primary and secondary. hete the 

All Write operations will happen in Primary
All Read operations will from secondary

if primary pod will goes down then primary only will pass that data to secondary and set that one as a write operator. if we achieve this we have to one of the server/pod 
and initiate the "mongo init()" and that pod will become primary. 


@@ suppose we have ceated a PVC in one namespace and PV in another. but that pv will bound with that PVC. bcoz PV is not a namespace specific. PV is a cluster specific. 


Set up Stateful set and headless service:
------------------------------------------

plz refer https://github.com/MithunTechnologiesDevOps/Kubernates-Manifests/blob/master/monodbstatefullset.yml to get manifest file. 


apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mongo
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 27017
      targetPort: 27017
  clusterIP: None        #here we use service type with None. we usualy use type and then mention the name of the service.
  selector:
    role: mongo
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: mongo
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      role: mongo
  serviceName: "mongo"
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        role: mongo
    spec:
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 10     #it will be helped while deleting the pods. they delete withing this time. 
      containers:
      - name: mongo
        image: mongo
        ports:
          - containerPort: 27017
        env:
          - name: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME
            value: devdb
          - name: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD
            value: devdb@123
        volumeMounts:
          - name: mongo-persistent-storage
            mountPath: /data/db
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: mongo-persistent-storage
      spec:
        #storageClassName: "gp2"
        accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi



Above in service manifest we can see

clusterIP: None      --> Here we use service type with None. we usualy use type(clusterIP/NodeportIP) and then mention the name of the service. it means its headless service. 
                         Here we cant get virtual IP address. 

In stateFulSet also we use PV and PVC concept. volumeMounts and VolumeClauimTemplate. bcoz in stateFulSet we will have diff volume for each replicas/pods. 

Here also we need storage class concept bcoz we have claim but we dont have volume to bound with. 

terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 10     #it will be helped while deleting the pods. they delete withing this time. why bcoz it might have active connections. so it needs some time
                                        to release those actions.
