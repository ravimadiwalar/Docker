HELM: 
------
     Helm is a package manager for k8s application. it allows you to install/deploy/remove/update applications on your k8s clusterin a similar manner to yum/apt for linux. 

HELM let you fetch, deploy and manage the lifecycle of applications, both 3rd party products (metric server, nginx ingress- which are not developed by us)and your own. 

=> HELM introduces several familiar concepts such as: 
 1) HELm Charts: Charts which are HELM packages (liek deb/rpm).
 2) HELM repositories:  whcih holds charts (similar to package repos)
 3) HELM CLI: A CLI with install/upgarde/remove commands the charts/packages. 

-> Why we use HELM? 
 K8s can be difficult to manage with all the objects you need to maintain (Configmap,/Secrets, pods, services etc) HELM manages all of this for you.  

Helm greatly simplifies the process of creating , managing and deploying applications usning HELM charts. In addition to that Helm also maintain a versioned history of every chart
(application) installation. if something goes wrong , you can simply call "helm rollback".
