K8s Volume: 
-----------
It is used to store the data what we have in the application container. A container file system lives as long as the container does. so wen a container terminates and restart, 
filesystem changes are lost. Volumes in K8s are very easy to manage. its basically a directory that get mounted to a pod. after telling the container to use volumes for storing 
evergreen information, you can safely modify the pods without ever losing your data.
